# Chaos King (dead)
(working title)

Run around, kill stuff, level up quick, pick from some awesome perks and weapons, and try to kill the king.  The king is the person who you hate the most, or whoever happens to be the highest level. 

This is a learning project for me but meant to make it to be a complete game for my learning and others as well. Feel free to pitch a pr if you have an interesting idea or better way of doing something.
